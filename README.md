# The Online Store Store!

This coding challenge is an online store with a merchant CP. Using Rails with React/Redux, basic CRUD implementations of items, merchants (item index + a store name), and transactions were made.

# To-do

## CSS

CSS. Any CSS. Dear lord.

## Stripe

The Stripe promise keeps thinking the element isn't mounted and I don't know why.
